# OS-Project
The Process Manager is created using Java and is made to simulate the basic process
management in an operating system. It allows the user to add, remove, schedule, and display
details of different processes. Each process has attributes such as ID, name, priority, CPU
utilization, memory utilization, and I/O utilization. Processes are categorized as either
CPU-bound or I/O-bound based on their resource utilization.
